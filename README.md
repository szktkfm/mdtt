<img src="assets/01.gif" width="700">

Editing markdown tables can be a drag. `mdtt` makes it easier with a slick TUI for terminal use and vim-style keybindings. It supports output to stdout and in-place file editing.

## üì¶ Installation

```sh
go install github.com/szktkfm/mdtt@latest
```

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/szktkfm/mdtt/releases)

## üé¨ Usage

To start editing your markdown table, simply run:

```sh
mdtt filename.md
```

Upon launching, `mdtt` will display the tables from your markdown file in a TUI.

While editing, you can utilize the following vim-like keybindings to navigate and modify your tables efficiently:

- Navigation: Use hjkl for left, down, up, and right movements.
- Editing: Press i to switch to insert mode and edit cell content, exit insert mode with esc or ctrl+c.
- Row and Column Manipulation:
  - Add a new row or colymn with `o`, `vo`.
  - Delete the current row or column with `dd`, `vd`.
  - Copy the current row or column with `yy`, `vy`.
  - Paste a copied row or column with `p`.

For direct editing and saving changes to the same file, use:

```sh
mdtt -i filename.md
```

You can use piping with `mdtt` as shown below:

```sh
pbpaste | mdtt | pbcopy
```

To create a new table without an existing file, run `mdtt` without any arguments:

```sh
mdtt
```

When multiple tables are present, you will be prompted to select the table you wish to edit.
