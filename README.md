# 🗓️ mdtt: Markdown Table Editor TUI

Editing markdown tables can be tedious. `mdtt` simplifies this with a TUI designed for direct terminal edits using vim-like keybindings. It supports outputting to stdout or inplace editing of markdown files.

## 📦 Installation

To install mdtt, just install it with go:

```sh
go install github.com/szktkfm/mdtt@latest
```

Or, download it:

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/szktkfm/mdtt/releases)

## 🎬 Usage
To start editing your markdown table, simply run:

```sh
mdtt filename.md
```
When launched, mdtt will display the tables from your markdown file in a TUI. 

While editing, you can utilize the following vim-like keybindings to navigate and modify your tables efficiently:

- Navigation: Use `hjkl` to move left, down, up, and right respectively.
- Editing: Enter insert mode by pressing `i` to start editing the cell content, and return to normal mode with `esc` or `ctrl+c`.
- Row and Column Manipulation:
    - Add a new row or colymn with `o`, `vo`.
    - Delete the current row or column with `dd`, `vd`.
    - Copy the current row or column with `yy`, `vy`.
    - Paste a copied row or column with `p`.

If you prefer to edit the file directly and save changes back to the same file, use:

```sh
mdtt -i filename.md
```

To pipe contents into mdtt:

```sh
pbpaste | mdtt | pbcopy
```

To create a new table without using an existing file, simply run mdtt without any arguments:

```sh
mdtt
```

If multiple tables are present, you'll be greeted with a view to select which table you want to edit.

```sh
mdtt multiple.md
```
